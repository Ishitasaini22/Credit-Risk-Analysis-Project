# Plan of action: 
Undertake research on how is statistics used in credit risk analysis domain <br />
Finalize a problem statement the team would like to address <br />
Identify necessary datasets to be used while solving the problem <br />
Develop a code to address the problem for the selected dataset <br />
Debugging of the code <br />
Synthesize findings after successful execution of the code <br />
Draw insights from findings <br />

# Theory : 
Credit risk analysis is a type of data analysis undertaken by lenders to quantify the level of default risk of a borrower. Default risk is defined as the probability of the borrower not being able to make scheduled principal and interest payments on time. This probability depends on variables measuring the creditworthiness and the financial condition of the borrower such as income, wealth, spending, savings etc. The model will try to estimate this unobservable probability of default using such observable variables.
